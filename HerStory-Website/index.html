					<h3>What</h3>
					<p>Refugees and migrants face high risks of violence, extortion and exploitation, including rape, transactional sex, human and organ trafficking. Women and girls, especially those travelling alone, face particularly high risks of certain forms of violence, including sexual violence by smugglers, criminal groups and individuals in countries along the route.

					<h3>Who</h3>
					<p>We are launching in both English and Arabic, and hope to translate and moderate submissions in both languages. At a later date we may include other languages, depending on demand.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box col-xs-12 col-md-4">
					<h3>Why</h3>
					<p>HerStory offers a way to record experiences and address isolation and loneliness amongst the female refugee community through a low-tech, audio-based, peer-led online service for women and girl refugees and those supporting them to share experiences of violence, abuse and exploitation and receive support in an area which is a serious challenge for government and humanitarian agencies.

			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
				<h4>Who are EmpowerHack?</h4>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9 position central">
					<p>EmpowerHack is a collective that brings creates sustainable design for women and girls in humanitarian contexts. Bridging the gap between technology, design, and NGOs to address key challenges, Empower Hack galvanises volunteers to create code that crosses borders.</p>
					<p>Despite up to 80% of world’s refugees being women and children, the problems faced by them are never at the forefront. EmpowerHack was born to change just that by taking collaborative design to scale. Female refugees are among the most vulnerable, facing sexual violence, coercion, forced and early marriage, social isolation, and a lack of access to gender-specific health care and education.</p>
